# Data Analystics projects
## Portfolio

This repository has the intention of sharing the projects I have done related to improving people's life standards
Mainly by understanding the behaviours and finding patterns so that we can create data-driven decisions. 

### I will use programming languages such as R and Python, in order to: extract, clean, organize, visualize and overall analyze data.

*Note: the data used for the projects are extracted from websites that offer open source datasets.*
